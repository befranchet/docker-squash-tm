Hi
I'm developer on the squashtest project (https://www.squashtest.org/en).
We've planned to publish our official docker image on dockerhub, but the "squahstest" organization 
is already created and this github repository (squashtest-shadow/docker-squash-tm) is linked to it.
That's why I suppose one of the commiters on this repository own the "squashtest" organization on docker Hub.
Is there any possibilities that this one give us the "squashtest" repository and so add user befranchet to the
owners group on "squashtest" organizations ?

Regards
